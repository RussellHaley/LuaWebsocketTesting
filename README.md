# LuaWebsocketTesting

This is to get help with my testing of the lua-http and cqueue (by extension) frameworks.

* lua_client.lua - The client that I am trying to connect with. Basically just Daurnimators example client
* nice_server.lua - Un-modified from Daurnimators example http server
* echo_server.lua - modified to try and get a stream to upgrade to a websocket. No luck yet.
