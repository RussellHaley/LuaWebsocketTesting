# LuaWebsocketTesting

This is to get help with my testing of the lua-http and cqueue (by extension) frameworks.

* lua_client.lua - The client that I am trying to connect with. Basically just Daurnimators example client
* nice_server.lua - Un-modified from Daurnimators example http server
* echo_server.lua - modified to try and get a stream to upgrade to a websocket. No luck yet.
* .idea - Directory for JetBrains IDEA Project. I'm testing the lua plugin because I'm a sucker for punishment
* lua-http-testing.iml - I think this a Package file? Akin to a Visual Studio project file (as compared to a Solution -> which is a jetbrains project? I think?)
